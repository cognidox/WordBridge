This is WordBridge, Cognidox Ltd's WordPress to Joomla bridge.

Using the Component:
-------------------

To use the component to link to a WordPress.com blog follow the steps
below:

1) Log into your Joomla site as a user who can add menu entries.
2) Use Joomla's Menu Manager to add a new menu item.
3) For the Menu Item Type, select WordBridge -> List of blog entries.
4) In the menu item's WordBridge Settings, set the Wordpress blog name
   to the name of your WordPress.com blog. e.g. if the blog is available
   at http://example.wordpress.com/, then the blog name to enter is
   'example'. If the blog is self-hosted, enter the fully qualified
   hostname of the blog. e.g. if the blog is http://myblog.example.com/, the
   blog name to enter is 'myblog.example.com'.
5) Save the menu item entry. The blog will now appear in Joomla. New 
   entries posted to the wordpress.com site will automatically appear
   in the Joomla site.
